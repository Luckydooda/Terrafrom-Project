# 📁 GitHub Actions Workflows

This directory contains GitHub Actions workflow files.

## 📍 Important

**GitHub Actions ONLY recognizes workflows in `.github/workflows/` directory!**

Workflows in other locations (like `GitHub-Actions/workflows/`) will NOT run automatically.

## 📂 Workflow Files

Place your `.yml` or `.yaml` workflow files here.

## 🔄 How It Works

1. Push workflow files to this directory
2. GitHub automatically detects them
3. Workflows appear in the **Actions** tab
4. They run based on their triggers

## 📱 Viewing on Mobile

- Use GitHub mobile app
- Navigate to repository → Actions tab
- View workflow runs and logs

**Note**: This directory structure is required for GitHub Actions to work!
